# About Me

Yo! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sufyan, a seasoned cybersecurity professional with a passion for protecting digital landscapes with over three years of hands-on experience. My passion for ethical hacking and penetration testing drives me to continuously explore innovative ways to identify vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by adversaries.

# Digital Spark

My first coding experience was back in primary school, where my teacher brought my class to the computer lab. There I found out about neopets, an online virtual pet game. One of the features included, creating a guild where I was able to decorate it using HTML and CSS. Although it was rudimentary, it sparked my interest in coding.

# Beyond Code

Gaming has always been a significant part of my life, offering not only entertainment but also the opportunity to sharpen problem-solving skills, strategic thinking, and creativity. Over the years, I've immersed myself in a variety of games that challenge my mind and push me to think outside the box. Notable favourites are Total War series, Company of Heroes and Sea of Thieves.
